# C# Toolbox 
A point of reference for C#

## Introduction
###### C# vs .NET
- C#: The language
- .NET: The framework for buuilding applications
  - CLR (Common Language Runtime)
  - Class Library
  
  -  __CLR History__
    - C/C++ translate to machine code
    - Java translates to bytecode
    - C# translates to IL code (Intermediate Language)
    _So, CLR is an application sitting in memory whose job it is to translate IL code to machine code (Just-In-Time Compilation, JIT)_
    
###### Application Structure
- Application: made up of classes who interact at runtime
- Class: 
  - Data (Attributes - make, model, colour)
  - Methods (Behaviour - Start(), Stop())
- NameSpace: Container for related classes, i.e for working with databases, graphics, security
- Assembly: Container for related namespaces, DLL or EXE
